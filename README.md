**Chaty**

# Have a look at the releases tab, to look how you can use this tool!

## A chatbot that can learn from you!

> This is a very simple chatbot, written in python that can learn from you by asking you the questions it does not know the answer to, its perfect if you want a chatbot with your own personal questions and answers!

> Its GUI(graphical user interface) based, so you do not need to learn anything to use this!

> The is some data in the data.jsonl file, its just a few questions and answers, you can add more questions and answers to it, or you can delete the data.jsonl file and start from scratch!

> The chatbot is not perfect, it can only learn from you, so if you ask it a question it does not know the answer to, it will ask you the answer to that question, and then it will remember it, so if you ask it the same question again, it will know the answer to it!

> If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!
